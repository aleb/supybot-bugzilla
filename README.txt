This is roughly based on the old Bugzilla plugin, but more strongly based on
the Bugzilla plugin for mozbot. It currently only works with Bugzilla version
2.23 and above, but support may be added for older Bugzillas at some point in
the future.

Also, the old Bugzilla plugin supported multiple Bugzillas, and this one
really is only designed to support one Bugzilla. I do hope to add
multiple-Bugzilla support in the future.

It has lots and lots of configuration options, and all the configuration
options have help, so feel free to read up after loading the plugin itself.
